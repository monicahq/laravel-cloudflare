"""Deterministically record which living specs cover a change.

Reads the project's living-specs registry (gate on `enabled: true`), runs the
shipped resolver over the changed files, and records the matched capability
names — most-specific first — onto `livingSpecs.loaded` in `.spec-context.json`
via the same additive writer the prose path used.

This exists so the RECORDING of living specs is a script call, not an AI
judgement: the specify command bodies call this one line instead of asking the
model to read the registry, check `enabled`, run the resolver, and decide. The
model's *reading* of the specs for drafting stays best-effort prose.

Contract (mirrors the rest of the capture runtime): best-effort, opt-in,
read-only. A missing registry, disabled feature, unresolvable feature dir,
resolver error, or absent dependency is a silent no-op that exits 0 — recording
state must never break or slow the run it observes.

Usage:
  record-living-specs.py --feature-dir <fd> --changed <file> [<file> ...]
