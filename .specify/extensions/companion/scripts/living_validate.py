"""The living-spec shape check — read-only, never a gate.

A living spec is only worth keeping if what gets folded into it is trustworthy,
and nothing checked the shape of one before writing to it. This reports six
kinds of break with a file, a line, a severity, a stable code and a one-line
fix. It changes nothing and always exits 0: a report that can fail the shell it
runs in is a gate wearing a report's clothes.

The fold imports this module and refuses on an error-level finding. The VS Code
extension carries its own twin in `src/features/specs/specShapeCheck.ts`,
because the shipped extension cannot assume these scripts are installed; the two
are pinned to `tests/fixtures/spec-shape/`.
