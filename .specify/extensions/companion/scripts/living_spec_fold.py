"""The living-spec fold-back: apply a feature spec's requirement deltas to the durable spec.

At mark-complete, the feature spec was the proposal and the living spec becomes
the record. Opt-in (livingSpecs.enabled), best-effort, and a clean no-op when the
feature spec carries no delta block.

Re-folding the same deltas is a no-op — ADDED resolves its heading through the
delta set's renames before both the existence check and the append, so it can
never re-add a section a RENAMED verb just renamed away from.
