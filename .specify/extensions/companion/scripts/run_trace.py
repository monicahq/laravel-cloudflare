"""The run self-trace — one line per handled capture or drift call.

Every script in the capture runtime returns 0 on failure by design, printing the
reason to stderr and discarding it. That contract is what keeps a capture defect
from halting a user's pipeline, and it is also why capture failures are invisible
today. The tracer is the record those discarded reasons land in: one append per
handled call, success or failure, written from inside the scripts the command
bodies already invoke — so it costs no extra call and adds no prompt weight.

The file is local, per-spec, size-capped, and never committed. Nothing but the
doctor reads it; no production code path may branch on its contents. A call that
could not resolve a spec at all lands in the repo-level unattributed log instead
of being dropped — that failure is precisely the one worth keeping.

Named `run_trace` rather than `trace` because the scripts directory is prepended
to `sys.path`, and a module called `trace` there would shadow the standard
library's for every process that loads one of these scripts.

Every failure inside this module is swallowed. It runs on paths that are already
failing, so a tracer that could raise would turn a recorded problem into a crash.
Stdlib only.
