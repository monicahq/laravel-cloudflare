"""Resolve living-spec paths for Companion capabilities.

Single source of truth for the rules the later Living Specs steps (sync / fold /
drift) call instead of re-interpreting the project's capability registry
(`living-specs.yml`, or the legacy `livingSpecs` block in `.specify/companion.yml`):

  - membership:  a file belongs to a capability if it matches any `match` glob
                 and no `exclude` glob.
  - path:        centralized -> `capabilities/<name>/<name>.spec.md` (default), or the
                 explicit `spec` path (colocated).
  - discovery:   union of configured capabilities and the on-disk scan of both
                 layouts (colocated `*.spec.md` and centralized
                 `capabilities/<name>/<name>.spec.md`), de-duped by resolved spec path
                 and by name.
  - boundary:    a subdirectory with its own capability registry (or legacy
                 `.specify/companion.yml`) is a separate project — the scan stops
                 there and never reports or promotes anything inside it.
  - ordering:    most-specific first (longest matching glob literal-prefix that
                 prefixes the file), tiebreak by capability name.
  - tiers:       `.spec.md` (hot, loaded in v1); `.rules.md` / `.coverage.md`
                 reserved siblings, never flagged as orphans.
  - orphans:     a spec of either layout in the tree not claimed by any capability.

OPT-IN: when `enabled` is unset/false (or there is no registry), the
resolver is inert — every mode returns empty with exit 0 and no error.

Usage:
  resolve-spec-paths.py --changed <file>...   # capabilities in scope (ordered)
  resolve-spec-paths.py --all                 # every capability (union) + orphans
  resolve-spec-paths.py --orphans             # unclaimed specs, either layout
  add --json for the machine-readable object; the default is a concise human
  list (capability names / orphan paths).
