# Resume Spec

Pick the pipeline back up where it stopped. This command reads the active
feature's recorded state, resolves the next step — carrying the recorded
`decisions` into scope — and dispatches the next `speckit.*` command. Inside the
implement step it continues at the next unchecked task.

## Name every command the way this project registers it

Commands are named in dot form throughout this body, `speckit.companion.plan`, because that is their canonical id, and without a leading slash, because the spelling a host actually registers is not always this one. Claude Code installs `/speckit-companion-plan`. Look at how the commands are installed in this project, under the agent's own commands or skills directory, and use that spelling every time you name one to the developer or dispatch one yourself. A dotted name typed into a host that registered dashes resolves to nothing at all.

## Prerequisites

- Verify Python is available by running `python3 --version`.
- If `python3` is not available, warn the user and skip:
  `[companion] Warning: python3 not detected; skipped resume`.
  Do not fail the host command.

## Execution

1. Resolve the next action from the repository root:

   ```bash
   python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/status-context.py
   ```

   (Pass `--feature-dir specs/<NNN>-<slug>` when you already know it.) The script
   reads `.spec-context.json`, or derives state from on-disk files when it is
   missing/malformed.

2. Parse the final `RESOLUTION: { … }` JSON line the script prints. It contains
   `currentStep`, `status`, `decisions[]`, `nextStep`, `nextCommand`,
   `nextActionLabel`, `nextTask`, and `complete`.

3. Branch on the resolution:

   - **`complete: true`** → print `Pipeline complete — nothing to resume.` and stop.
     Do not dispatch anything.
   - **`empty: true`** (no recorded state and no spec files) → print
     `Nothing to resume (no spec files or recorded state found).` and stop.
   - **`nextTask` is set** (inside the implement step) → continue implementation at
     `nextTask`: invoke `speckit.implement`, instructing it to resume at the next
     unchecked task.
   - **otherwise** → invoke `nextCommand` (e.g. `speckit.plan`, `speckit.tasks`,
     `speckit.implement`).

4. When you dispatch, state the recorded `decisions[]` as in-scope context for the
   step you are running, so prior decisions carry forward and the user does not
   re-specify them.

## Dispatch note

Resume dispatches the **already-installed** `speckit.*` commands. It does not
require a `specify workflow resume` CLI subcommand, so it works on the stock
installed spec-kit version. The dispatched command runs its own `after_*` capture
hook, which writes the resulting `history[]` entry — resume itself writes no state.

## Output

```text
Resuming <name> from <currentStep> (<status>).
Decisions in scope:
  - <decision>
Next: <action>  →  dispatching <command>
```

- Tasks/implement step → `Next: Continue implementation at <task>  →  dispatching speckit.implement`.
- No decisions recorded → omit the "Decisions in scope" block.

## Graceful Degradation

Best-effort: if `python3` is missing or the feature directory cannot be resolved,
warn to stderr and stop without dispatching. Never fail the host command.
